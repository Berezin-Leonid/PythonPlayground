**Problem 1.** Solve the following quadratic equation for $x$:

$$x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0$$

**Solution.** We can solve the equation by factoring:

$$\begin{align*}
    x^2 - 4x + 4 &= 0 \\
    (x - 2)^2 &= 0 \\
    x - 2 &= 0 \\
    x &= 2
    \end{align*}$$

Therefore, the solution to the equation is $x = 2$.
